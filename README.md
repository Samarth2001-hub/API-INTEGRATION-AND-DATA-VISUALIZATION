In the first task I created a weather map by using the python programming language that can fetch or give the details of the climatic conditions of a particular city.For doing the coding part of this task I made the use of visual studio code.Before performing my coding part I installed some of the libraries like the matplotlib , seaborn and as well as pandas in the command prompt by making the use of the pip command. After getting over with my installation process I created my new account in open weather map platform and after that my open weather map API key was generated automatically and I used that API key in my code.In my code I chose London as my prefered city.The code made by me creates a matplotlib visualization with basic bars and value labels and a seaborn visualization with a more modern look using the "viridis" color palette.Both of these plots show temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed. After running the code it fetched the current weather data for the specified city and it created two visualizations the first one is the matplotlib bar plot showing weather metrics and the second one is the seaborn bar plot with a different style.
